# Plotly- Belly Button Biodiversity

# Background
In this assignment, we built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Plotly-Bar Chart
 In the fist task we read our json file, using a D3 library, and produced a barchart with a drop down menu that illustrated the top 10 bacteria found in the navel.

# Plotly Bubble Chart
We created an bubble chart illustration that gave the following:

Otu_ids for the x values.


Sample_values for the y values.


Sample_values for the marker size.


Otu_ids for the marker colors.


Otu_labels for the text values.

# Demographic Information
I wrote some code that displays the demographic information from the data.

# Guage Chart
A guage chart was created to show how often an individual should wash their navel per week.
